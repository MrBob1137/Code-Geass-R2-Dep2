 news.1.t:0 "International Group NAR Condems Britannia!"
 news.1.d:0 "Recently, the international human rights group known as NAR issued a statement condemning the policies imposed on the Numbers (or, in other words, the subjugated native peoples in colonial areas) by the Holy Britannian Empire. Specifically, the statement denounces the oppressive conditions reserved for the Numbers and urges a review of current imperial policy. The group became famous after a series of attacks on the Chinese Federation and the Eunuchs, but it also lent its support in several cases of corruption in the Euro-Universe. Given its reputation, it was under surveillance by several intelligence services, but the Britannian Foreign Minister has just declared that the infamous NAR will be put under the category of terrorist organization.\n\n Surprisingly, Britannia has gotten a huge wave of criticism around the world, but no concrete action is expected to be taken by the other superpowers."

 news.2.t:0 "Airstrike on Manila!"
 news.2.d:0 "A month ago, several airstrikes took place in the capital of the Philippines, Manila. The bombings appear to have been carried out by the Holy Britannian Empire. Several international newspapers highlighted the devastation caused by the attack. This was also confirmed by journalists present in the country.\n\n According to a Japanese military officer, based on the scarring on the landscape, no effort was made to reduce collateral damage against the native population. The country has close ties with the Chinese Federation, and a strong response from the superpower is expected. Despite this, it seems unlikely that a full-blown war will break out anytime soon."

 news.3.t:0 "The Oriental Incident"
 news.3.d:0 "After the Britannian conquest of the Philippines, Japan, known for its rigid neutrality, decided to align its policy with the plans of the EU and the Chinese Federation. In particular, the two superpowers and their allies applied enormous economic pressure on Britannia, with a total blockade of ports and various economic sanctions, in an attempt to reach negotiations on the situation in the Pacific. \n\n Britannia, to the surprise of many observers, responded in extremes; with a quick and clumsy declaration and promises of retaliation. Many consider this a major international defeat for the mighty Britannian Empire, but Euro-Universe cooperation with China is unlikely to continue after this..."

 news.5.d:0 "With great surprise from the rest of the world, Japan has managed to hold off the pacific superpower, the Holy Britannian Empire, for much longer than anticipated, although sever casualties are being reported from both nations. After months of brutal fightings, a major part of Britannina political and military elite has pressured the government and the Nobility to sign a peace deal and avoid further losses.\n\nObviously, the truce will contain favourable terms for Britannia, since it will guarantee a large concession regarding Sakuradite extraction, plus to lending of numerous ports and strategic islands.\n\nEventually, the war has resulted in a deep destabilization of both countries and international experts are worried that these tensions might explode..."

 news.6.t:0 "Division of Japan"
 news.6.d:0 "Few could expect that the outcome of the Second Pacific War would have been a second partition among the three superpowers, but apparently Japan is now splitted between in two rump states.\n\nAfter the risky decision of Britannia to continue the war, despite several losses and a general stalemate, EU and, especially, China have sent an invasion force to avoid a complete Britannian take-over of Japan. In particular, under the excuse of humanitarian intervention, the Chinese Army have established a de-facto Military Protectorate over southern Japan while Britannia created a similar administration in the northen regions.\n\nTensions are high in the devastated country, since a lot of Kururugi's officials, generals and common citizens are already flooding to South Japan and could create further chaos in the cities."

BRT.1.t:0 "Empress Marianne is Dead!"
BRT.1.d:0 "This is a disaster!\n\nOne of the Empire's most important Empresses, known as the Lady Marianne, has been assassinated in the Imperial Palace of Pendragon, and all of her personal guards are dead. The attack was carried out in broad daylight, and the perpetrators are not yet known to the public, though many consider it a terrorist attack.\n\nMarianne was in the building with her two children, Lelouch and Nunnally Vi Britannia, who witnessed the entire scene. In particular, her youngest daughter, Nunnally, eventually lost her sight and use of both legs. The investigation has already begun under the authority of Cornelia Li Britannia, former head of the Royal Guards. The situation is very tense in the government, but the Emperor decided to cover the news in the initial moments."
BRT.1.a:0 "This could have been avoided..."

BRT.2.t:0 "Something is Up"
BRT.2.d:0 "After weeks of hard investigation, employing the best agents in the entire district, we discovered some connections between the murder and parts of the government itself. The hidden web also seems to connect to the Secret Order of Geass, a fanatical religious organization that has influence in the Royal Family. At this point, it is likely that the Order and corrupt guards within the palace are behind the assassination. Even if it is an internal plot, it would create a huge shock in the hands of the press and must be kept secret, at all costs."
BRT.2.a:0 "This is getting out of hand..."

BRT.3.t:0 "Dead End"
BRT.3.d:0 "We were digging deeper and deeper into the Order of Geass and eventually some suspects were found within the organization. Despite this, we felt closely watched and one day it happened.\n\n While we were working in our office, Imperial Intelligence raided the facility. They were not alone, the police had already surrounded the entire place and agents were ready to arrest us. Soon, we were dismissed from the case, which was considered unsolved and archived.\n\n It seems that Emperor Charles, advised by senior Geass figures, ordered the complete closure of the case and the destruction of any evidence. At this point it is clear that the emperor knows much more than we thought, but it is useless to continue or even protest."
BRT.3.a:0 "Watch your Back, dear detective..."

BRT.4.t:0 "Priorities"
BRT.4.d:0 "Despite the fact that the case is now closed, the consequences of the aftermath are still present. In particular, the other two superpowers have noticed our weaker position and have taken a more aggressive attitude toward us. In addition, many tensions and fears have arisen in the royal government and the royal family itself. Now, we have to decide the area where our limited resources should go first."
BRT.4.a:0 "Prioritize the internal situation."
BRT.4.b:0 "Deal with the foreign threat."

BRT.5.t:0 "Operation Rolling Thunder"
BRT.5.d:0 "After weeks of preparations, we are ready to launch an invasion of the Chinese-controlled Philippines. It is important to capture the entire archipelago quickly, so that we can outmaneuver the enemy and avoid a direct confrontation.\n\n Three main attacks will start from Area 10; in particular, the main armies will be on Palau, Guam, and Iwo Jima, with full naval and air support. In the end, future territories will be critical to the future expansion into the Pacific theater of the great Britannian Empire."
BRT.5.a:0 "Start the Operation."

BRT.6.t:0 "Escalation"
BRT.6.d:0 "The operation is a complete failure.\n\n Although we have made several gains, the entire archipelago is not under Britannian control. The war is dragging on for too much time and the Chinese Federation has sent us an ultimatum. Surrender the island to the Eunuchs or face a total war. It’s important to highlight that the last option is very risky, since our military in the Pacific isn’t at full strength and the Knights of Rounds are busy in South America. After these considerations, Emperor Charles thinks that the risks are too high..."
BRT.6.a:0 "Continue The War!"
BRT.6.b:0 "Back Down..."

BRT.7.t:0 "The Chinese Federation retaliates!"
BRT.7.d:0 "After our attack on the Philippines, it appears that the Chinese Federation formed a temporary alliance with the other superpower, the Euro-Universe, and pressured Japan to align with its interests. As a result of this surprising move, Britannia is now isolated from most of the world's trade due to numerous economic sanctions and embargoes. While this will greatly damage the Britannian economy in the short term, it could be an opportunity to achieve Imperial autarky and prove the greatness of the Homeland once and for all!"
BRT.7.b:0 "This was unexpected. Reorganize the budget with further austerity!"

BRT.8.t:0 "Honolulu Proposal"
BRT.8.d:0 "To our surprise, the Prime Minister found an interesting compromise with the European Union. In particular, he met with some Russian delegates in the Hawaii Naval Command to discuss the recent incident and improve the bitter relations between the two superpowers. The Paris government is ready to secretly loosen part of the trade blockade and allow limited trade relations. In return, we will give the Attu Island, where the EU has laid a claim several years ago, to the Russian Republic. Considering its position in the extreme north, it won't be an important strategic loss."
BRT.8.a:0 "Accept the Resolution"
BRT.8.b:0 "Refuse the Resolution"

BRT.9.t:0 "Departure of Prince Lelouch and Princess Nunnally"
BRT.9.d:0 "The Emperor has decided on a permanent arrangement for Prince Lelouch and Princess Nunnally; the children of the deceased Empress Marianne will go to Japan for an indefinite period of time. This move will be a useful way to turn Lelouch and Nunnally into political pawns and, at the same time, reassure the Royal Family. In addition, their safety will be assured in the Asian nation from the plans of any hitmen in the Imperial Capital, Pendragon. Eventually, they will be under the protection of Prime Minister Kururugi and his son, as we will tell the press that their trip is for educational purposes only."
BRT.9.a:0 "It is necessary."

BRT.10.t:0 "Total Victory Over Japan!"
BRT.10.d:0 "Operation Tidal Waves was a great success!\n\nIn few months, we have managed to crush any Japanese resistance with our new advanced weapons, the Knightmares. After ruthless fighting in the streets, the Japanese government finally surrendered, while Prime Minister Kururugi disappeared and the country was left in a state of chaos and anarchy. Furthermore, many officials escaped to our enemy, China, and numerous enemy Generals and Officers went into hiding.\n\nDespite this, large deposits of Sakuradite are now in our hand and we have shown our muscles to the world. Eventually, as we are forming Area 11, the authority of Charles and the Imperial family has been firmly consolidated and the future looks bright.\n\nAll Hail Britannia!"
BRT.10.a:0 "Establish the New Area."
BRT.10.b:0 "Establish the New Area.\n(Play as Area 11)"

BRT.11.t:0 "A Protracted Stalemate"
BRT.11.d:0 "Operation Tidal Waves is a partial failure, since our main force have failed to force Japan into an unconditional surrender and capture the major cities of the country. The war has already ground on for over half a year and many generals are worried that this swamp will draw resources away from other vital theaters.\n\nAlthough Emperor Charles wants to continue the war, Prime Minister Odysseus and other Ministers has proposed an alternative peace deal, that will grant us access to all Sakuradite mines along minor concessions. Eventually we must decide carefully, since that could be taken as an indication of weakness by the other great powers"
BRT.11.a:0 "We won't give up!"
BRT.11.b:0 "Demand a Truce."

BRT.13.t:0 "Movements In The Shadows"
BRT.13.d:0 "V.V. was the first ally of Charles during the Emblem of Blood, and this granted him a powerful position in the current administration. Allowing him to retain a considerable freedom of maneuver to do as he whims.\n\nCurrently, V.V. has been the main antagonist to Marianne's influence, representing a counter-force to her power. He remains the least vocal opponent, preferring an underhanded approach to avoid unnecessary attention. The Secret Services are always keeping an eye, though, and only the Emperor's order could stop any further investigation."
BRT.13.a:0 "Something's up."

BRT.14.t:0 "Memories Of the Emblem Of Blood"
BRT.14.d:0 "Prior to Charles' ascension to the throne, a violent internal feud occurred within the Britannian imperial family. During this period, assassination and betrayals were frequented among members of the various claimants that eyed the throne. In addition, this era saw domestic instability at its peak throughout the Empire's history.\n\nThe situation was partially solved with the intervention of several noble families, who supported the succession of a strong leader that could put an end to the bloodshed, in exchange for the reduction of some of the nobility's power (albeit for a brief period) - And that leader was Charles."

While these words inspire the soldiers of the Empire and strengthen the power of the government, they also increase the popularity of the extremist faction, the Purists.

In particular, in the newly conquered territories, they are called "Numbers," and their culture is destroyed with an aggressive policy of assimilation or, in the worst cases, ethnic cleansing.

BRT_investigating_desc:0 "A special team of detectives has been formed to solve the case, but we must keep an eye on them..."
BRT_case_unsolved:0 "Unsolved Case?"
BRT_case_unsolved_desc:0 "They have crossed a red line, uncovering too many secrets in the Imperial Government. We have to stop this investigation NOW."
BRT_continue_plan:0 "Contact the Prime Minister"
BRT_continue_plan_desc:0 "After the accident, we have to stabilize the situation, and Prime Minister Odysseus can help us with that."
BRT_troops:0 "Start Border Clashes"
BRT_troops_desc:0 "We can initiate some border clashes with Japan on the Island of Ishigaki, so the nation will not interfere with our affairs. In particular, Britannian patrol craft are going to fire warnings shots at any Japanese fishing boats near the coast and, if necessary, there will be a forced search on them."
BRT_bombings:0 "Manila's Airstrikes"
BRT_bombings_desc:0 "The Philippine is one of the most exposed puppets of the Chinese Federation and, because of its location near Area 10 and the Britannian Pacific Fleet, a perfect target. To cripple their military infrastructure and their morale, we are going to perform a major airstrike on the capital, regardless of civilian victims. Furthermore, the Chinese response will be slow."
BRT_army:0 "Take the Philippines"
BRT_army_desc:0 "The Philippines are one of the few territories that stand between us and the Chinese Federation, it must be brought under our leash as soon as possible in preparation for our Asian campaigns."
BRT_oriental:0 "The Oriental Incident"
BRT_oriental_desc:0 "After the Operation, we received condemnations from all nations in Asia, and the most important ones have decided to embargo our goods and impose harsh sanctions on our trade. This is a disaster for the economy, we must be quick to act or the consequences will be severe."
BRT_laziness_odysseus:0 "Sway PM Odysseus"
BRT_laziness_odysseus_desc:0 "Prime Minister Odysseus, despite his initial commitment in response to Marianne's death, is becoming lazier by the day. We need to have a little "talk" to assure his active participation in state politics."
BRT_aid_MON_rebels:0 "Aid Mongolian Rebels"
BRT_aid_MON_rebels_desc:0 "Many ministers have proposed a strong reaction against the embargo, that being the funding of several separatist groups in Mongolia. They will be reached using our connections with Yakuza, the Kyoto House and several Triads in Chinese territory."
BRT_block_sup:0 "Flex Our Military Might"
BRT_block_sup_desc:0 "In this fundamental moment, it's a must to remind the other superpowers what we are capable of, in case their aggressive stance will go too far. The Knights Of Rounds are perfect for this role, since they will be deployed in strategic zones in the Pacific and Atlantic Ocean."
BRT_diplomacy:0 "Propose Negotations"
BRT_diplomacy_desc:0 "If we hope to partly recover our economy, we must open diplomatic negotiations with the Europeans. In particular, we can organize a territorial exchange of the Attu Islands, in exchange for a secret trade of our goods. The northern islands are going to become part of Russia, but their strategic value for Operation Tidal Waves is insignificant."
BRT_gathering:0 "Improve Armament Research"
BRT_gathering_desc:0 "While the Philippine’s invasion was a costly operation, we can divert some funds to improve the quality of the Army in new advanced technologies, called Knightmare Frames. These weapons will be powerful enough to crush the Japanese."
BRT_knights:0 "Deploy Knightmare Units"
BRT_knights_desc:0 "In these weeks we are deploying our best troops, the Knights of Rounds, in Area 10 to prepare the invasion of Japan. Our pacific fleet is ready and already positioned near Iwo Jima, Alaska and the West Coast. Revolutionary technologies are about to be used."
BRT_war:0 "Operation Tidal Waves"
BRT_war_desc:0 "Now, we can officially start Operation Tidal Waves, the invasion of mainland Japan. In this case, we must be quick, or we risk the reaction of the others supepowers."
BRT_foreign_situation:0 "Confront the Chinese Federation"
BRT_foreign_situation_desc:0 "In order to regain our soft power in the world stage, we can fight our rival, the Chinese Federation, in the Pacific. Despite their numbers, the Chinese Army isn’t ready for a surprise attack on their dominions in Asia."
BRT_front_secured:0 "The Situation is Under Control"
BRT_front_secured_desc:0 "After many troubles, we have finally managed to stabilize the internal situation and public order. In this state of things, we can start the Pacific Campaign without fear of domestic unrests or disorders."
BRT_nobility_ties:0 "Reaffirm Nobility's Dominance"
BRT_nobility_ties_desc:0 "It’s important to reaffirm the dominance of the nobility in the Britannian political system and support the mighty families of Pendragon, who helped us various times during the Emblem of Blood era. Furthermore, this will further weaken the radical factions and, at the same time, boost oligarchic financial conglomerates."
BRT_control_purists:0 "Sideline the Purist Faction"
BRT_control_purists_desc:0 "The Purists have just acquired a dangerous amount of popularity, among the Imperial soldiers, thanks to the Marianne affair. They currently represent a danger to the crown. They must be side-lined from Britannian politics, for now."
BRT_reassure_family:0 "Reassure the Royal Family"
BRT_reassure_family_desc:0 "Lelouch and Nunnally, children of Marianne, are in an extremely dangerous position in Pendragon and, after Lelouch’s ridiculous request, they must be sent to Japan as bargaining tools. As members of the royal family, they are going to be under Kururugi’s protection."
BRT_domestic_front:0 "Manage the Domestic Front"
BRT_domestic_front_desc:0 "In order to further stabilize the nation, the Prime Minister has advised a number of measures to counter internal troublemakers and hidden threats."
BRT_protectionism:0 "Enact Protectionist Policies"
BRT_protectionism_desc:0 "In order to defend Britannian industry after the embargo, we must re-direct our effort towards our domestic economic situation. In particular, a package of protectionist measures will preserve the competitiveness of many companies, although it will be politically costly."
BRT_KN_dev:0 "Continue Knightmare Development"
BRT_KN_dev_desc:0 "Even before the death of Marianne, our scientists were experimenting the power of Sakuradite to create powerful weapons called "Knightmares", that will grant an enormous advantage with our enemies. The research is complex, though, and it will still require some time."
BRT_KN_module_1:0 "KN Research-Phase 1"
BRT_KN_module_1_desc:0 "The base for Knightmare's development is the creation of emergency survival cockpits for conventional vehicles. Equipped with rocket engines to fly the crew away from the wreck, the contraptions are equipped with artificial legs to allow greater mobility. Limited room inside said vehicles restricted the number of legs to two."
BRT_KN_module_2:0 "KN Research-Phase 2"
BRT_KN_module_2_desc:0 "The Landspinner Propulsion System is essentially a set of wheels that can be attached to the back of each heel of a Knightmare Frame's foot. This will allow greater mobility and speed to our future weapons."
BRT_KN_module_3:0 "KN Research-Phase 3"
BRT_KN_module_3_desc:0 "For our next experiments, we will create the Factsphere Sensor, which is is essentially an advanced camera that relays live thermographic images and data to the pilot. It uses both an active and a passive sensor for microwave band and visible light. A fire-control use environmental sensor, in addition to acoustic pickup."
BRT_KN_ashford:0 "Help Ashford Foundation"
BRT_KN_ashford_desc:0 "Ashford family has always been a great ally among our government,and they are also managing a pretty efficient institute of research, the Ashford Foundation. With their help, we will be able to finally create a proper Knightmare module to standardize into our army."
BRT_KN_old_guard:0 "Fight The Old Guard"
BRT_KN_old_guard_desc:0 "Several old generals, including our current chief of army, are still opposing the creation of Knightmares. They rely on more traditional tacticts and they consider Knightmares as science-fiction. They must be sidelined with direct orders from Emperor Charles."
BRT_KN_glasgow:0 "Glasgow's Deployment"
BRT_KN_glasgow_desc:0 "At last, we have managed to integrate the latest of current technologies into a reliable Knightmare frame, which will be put in several divisions of our army; ready to confront Japan and its protectors. This represents a great day for our empire - All Hail Britannia!"

BRT_piece_empire:0 "A New Piece To The Empire..."
BRT_piece_empire_desc:0 "At last! Victory! Japan, that ugly stain on the face of the globe, is no more! Knight Bismarck Waldstein and the mighty forces of the Holy Britannian Empire have crushed all resistance! Integrating that morsel of land is no trivial matter, however, and the loyal servant of the Emperor has his work cut out for him."
BRT_see_results:0 "And The Winner Is..?"
BRT_odysseus_resign:0 "...And Now An Empty Position"
BRT_odysseus_resign_desc:0 "Crown Prince Odysseus eu Britannia has proven himself nothing short of a complete embarrassment to the Britannian Imperial Family. Ousting him of much of his responsibilities is an easy matter, and by sidelining him, the ferocious contenders circling his imaginative throne can squabble bitterly over the scraps. "
BRT_struggle_begins:0 "Let The Struggle Begins!"
BRT_struggle_begins_desc:0 "Power! Power! Power! Britannia is ripe for the taking, pieces on the board arranged neatly, and only the final touches remain for a theatrical performance of grand proportions! Prince Schneizel el Britannia, Prime Minister of the Holy Britannian Empire, and First Princess Guinevere de Britannia are locked in a bitter struggle for the reins of authority."
BRT_diplomatic_field:0 "Diplomatic Upheaval"
BRT_diplomatic_field_desc:0 "We have stirred the hornet's nest. Our ambitious invasion of the Japanese archipelago has done little to improve our international standing. Responding to our aggressive measure, both the Chinese Federation and the United Republic of Europia have declared their intent to respond in kind, raising the question of a possible worldwide conflict."
BRT_economic_field:0 "Economic Troubles"
BRT_economic_field_desc:0 "Unsurprisingly, the international blockade of our waters has, in other words, damaged our economic machine and has left us vulnerable to outside influence. We must remedy this serious thorn in our side lest everything grinds to a halt. Already high-ranking officials have set about concocting half-baked solutions; it will be solely up to us to decide what path we shall take in the coming weeks, if not months that follow."
BRT_political_field:0 "Political Skermishes"
BRT_political_field_desc:0 "It seems, however far-fetched, that the heavy-handed approach to the internal struggles of our empire has culminated in a full-out conflict between the myriad distinctive components of our governmental structure. We must deal with this problem hastily or else face widespread subversion from every corner. Time is of the essence that much is certain."
BRT_new_frontier:0 "Eyes On The New Frontier"
BRT_new_frontier_desc:0 "Across the shining sea, there is a dark and terrible monstrosity, a dragon that threatens to swallow up our newfound jewels, eager for the blood of our children. China or the Chinese Federation, that mystical realm, is a very real hazard to our international initiatives. We must smother that flame out before it engulfs us all."
BRT_lost_homeland:0 "Eyes On The Lost Homeland"
BRT_lost_homeland_desc:0 "Europia is a degenerative waste of fresh air; their self-destructive policies have set them on a collision course with the iceberg of fate. But, fear not, we will bring to their morally bankrupt masses the greatest gift of life: the sweet release of death. Our general officers clamor for the opportunity to bring down the hammer upon their land; we will take it ALL for ourselves!"
BRT_reinforce_new_areas:0 "Defend New Areas"
BRT_reinforce_new_areas_desc:0 "Shockingly it has come to our attention that our Britannian Ground Force is incapable of defending every square inch of our glorious empire. Instead, hesitatingly, their commanders have proposed that we rapidly expand the Britannian Foreign Legion to account for the severe shortage of able-bodied individuals. We must stoke the flames of hatred, patriotism, and fanatical dedication to our Holy Emperor to unlock the floodgates of the war machine."
BRT_reinforce_atlantic_fleet:0 "Fund The Atlantic Fleet"
BRT_reinforce_atlantic_fleet_desc:0 "Fleet carriers, heavy cruisers, destroyers, submarines; the whole lot of our Atlantic defense grouping sits rusting away at the pier. We have neglected a crucial aspect of our global force projection, permitting our sailors to become lethargic, fattened on the spoils of past exploits. By appointing new blood, determined young naval officers to standings of tremendous responsibility, we will rejuvenate and adequately outfit this force for the next significant battle on the ocean's surface."
BRT_paris_conference:0 "Paris' Secret Meeting"
BRT_paris_conference_desc:0 "The United Republic of Europia should be "reassured," about our intentions, placated where possible, and duped into thinking that they are "safe" from our reach. Greasing the palms of their clumsy, incompetent buffoons they call go-betweens will be a walk in the park, not metaphorically either. Some accommodations potentially might have to be made for the sake of our other interests, but these matter little. When we have what we need, and we WILL get what we need, Europia will be swept aside in one swift stroke of a pen."
BRT_china_detente:0 "Detende With China"
BRT_china_detente_desc:0 "Even if it pains us to the core, we must reach a mutual understanding with the barbarians of the Chinese Federation. Engaging in highly publicized engagements between our respective ambassadorial representatives will do much to mend the gap between our two nation-states. Eu- we dare not mutter that accursed word, are power-hungry, narrow-minded, argumentative fellows with a clear lack of tact in the sphere of diplomacy. If we utilize soothing, complicated words, surely we will scramble their biologically inferior minds to the point where they must agree with our terms on every subject."
BRT_shuffle_foreign_minister:0 "Shuffle Foreign Minister"
BRT_shuffle_foreign_minister_desc:0 "We will never gain complete control over the foreign ministry with the current administration in place. Carefully, we will have to dispose of the opposition, in particular, the current minister, whether by force or persuasion. Once cleared off the board, he can be sent into retirement with considerable luxury at his disposal. No need to aggravate an already tense situation."
BRT_favour_corporatism:0 "Favour Corporatism"
BRT_favour_corporatism_desc:0 "Oh! What is that irritating noise? Our working class complains endlessly about their lot in life, assuming they have a right to the pursuit of happiness. What nonsense! Regardless, we as their benevolent betters must furnish them with an inkling of self-respect. Restructuring the lowers rungs of our society into corporate groups will do much good in the future, or at least, we hope."
BRT_protectionism_thesis:0 "Protectionist Thesis"
BRT_protectionism_thesis_desc:0 "Free market economy? We shall never allow such an aberration to exist within our borders! We will restrict the imports gathered from foreign nation-states, urging our state-owned companies to produce self-sufficiently. Of course, there will be some problems, nothing to worry about, though. Our economic advisors have reassured us that this is the right path to take."
BRT_mantain_balance:0 "Mantain A Balance"
BRT_mantain_balance_desc:0 "Why the unnecessary change? We have all the pieces of the puzzle; we just have to put them together. Uprooting the organization of our society into corporate groups would be detrimental to the well-being of the state, not to mention threatening the life of luxury afforded to the higher classes. If we are incapable of maintaining the allegiance of the highest-ranking nobles, we are doomed to fail. Strangely enough, it might just be possible to avoid the tip of the iceberg by finding common ground with the reformist-minded paper pushers and the idiotic, bumbling fools of our aristocracy."
BRT_discuss_state_role:0 "Discuss State's Role"
BRT_discuss_state_role_desc:0 "State interference in the economic sector has proved disastrous in the past. Hence our strategic initiative to privatize a small part of that beast, enabling domestic and foreign investors to open up our shores to new markets previously left untouched. Yet, it is now up to us to determine if we will follow a more lenient or tighter model following this course of action."
BRT_favour_technocracy:0 "Favour Technocracy"
BRT_favour_technocracy_desc:0 "Change is necessary. We have let decadence, corruption, and, worst of all, incompetence plague every major part of our economy. We must surgically remove the tumor that is nepotism before it is too late. Titles are pointless without the financial standing to back them up. We have already terrorized the lesser classes of our empire, instead, we must ease back on our suffocating industrial production quotas. Consequently, by promoting self-sufficiency in all aspects of our economic infrastructure, we will distance ourselves from the dependence on foreign entities abroad."
BRT_take_key_positions:0 "Seize Key Positions"
BRT_take_key_positions_desc:0 "We must maneuver our supporters into the fledgling economic apparatus; every position from minister to foreman must be filled by those who have sworn allegiance to us and us alone. Who will be the competition to achieve this lofty goal? We must answer this question, or else everything might fall apart on this valuable front."
BRT_buy_britannian:0 "Buy Britannian!"
BRT_buy_britannian_desc:0 ""Made in Britannia" - We will flood the foreign markets with cheaply produced commodities, mass-manufactured in the economic zones scattered across our empire, and with this decisive action seize control of the global market one nation at a time. Who will protest? Not the consumers, preoccupied with cramming their greedy pieholes with the riches of our homeland. Europia, in particular, is wide open. We will assume total dominance over everything that catches our fancy! "
BRT_economy_science:0 "What Is Science Wihout Economics?"
BRT_economy_science_desc:0 "Scientists constantly complaining about so-called "blunders" on the part of our economic advisory councils is frying our nerves. Why can't they fall in line like the rest of their counterparts? We will subordinate their "research institutions" to the will of our production ministries, tying them to the very thing they resent. Naturally, they will see the error of their ways and refrain from making disparaging remarks toward our trusted lieutenants."
BRT_shuffle_economic_minister:0 "Shuffle Economic Minister"
BRT_shuffle_economic_minister_desc:0 "Unfortunately, the economic minister has proven most resistant to our desired changes. He will have to be dealt with. Already at this very moment, our operatives are showing him the "error" of his ways. Following his resignation from public office, he will have a heart attack, and his family will disappear off the face of the earth. Tragic, really. But, it couldn't be helped, given the solemnity shrouding our economic endeavors."
BRT_purist_question:0 "Purists' Question"
BRT_purist_question_desc:0 "Evil is rooted at the very center of our empire, slithering in the darkness, coiling around the hearts and minds of our best and brightest. We have allowed, unwillingly, monstrosities to stake their claim to the riches of our success. Even if we must swallow our pride, the Purist Faction must either be allowed to purge this black stain or be crushed in favor of some alternative method. There is no middle ground."
BRT_areas_question:0 "Areas' Question"
BRT_areas_question_desc:0 "Our regional establishment is a crumbling mess, nothing short of a complete disaster. We have failed to satisfy even the most basic of our long-term objectives; insurrection is looming on the horizon. Brute force is no longer an option, according to the most trusted of our special representatives on the ground, and will only aggravate the situation. We might, much to our dismay, have our hands forced by variables outside of our control. Convincing our viceroyalties to undertake a drastic shift in policy, regardless, is no easy task for any single individual."
BRT_cult_question:0 "Cult's Question"
BRT_cult_question_desc:0 "Religious fanatics and their disastrous designs have been a consistent threat to the internal integrity of the throne for far too long. Their obsession with superstitious nonsense has at last drawn the ire of military commanders, high-ranked nobles, and the greatest scientific minds our empire has to offer. When the time is right, we will have to stamp out these freaks of nature or show mercy and authorize them to labor under our careful guidance. The choice is ours, but only the future will condemn or validate our actions. "
BRT_shuffle_remaining_ministers:0 "Shuffle Remaining Ministers"
BRT_shuffle_remaining_ministers_desc:0 "Everyone remaining who has defiantly opposed us in every aspect of the governing structure shall be crushed beneath our jackboot. Blood will saturate the marble foundations of our palace, trustworthy puppets inaugurated in their place, unquestioning in their devotion to our every whim."

In particular, during the Napoleonic invasion of mainland Britain, many aristocrats and nobles escaped with the royal family to their dominions in North America.\nAfter the first hard years, the new nation consolidated into an absolute monarchy and gradually extended its rule through both continents, inspired by the principles of Social Darwinism. Eventually, the Britannian Empire became a global superpower, with advancements in science and military technologies."
